This template uses [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (and [csvsimple](https://ctan.org/pkg/csvsimple)) for producing questionnaires.

# Items
For adapting the items, just change the `CSV`-file and recompile the `*.tex`. The order can be randomised with using, e.g., [https://www.random.org/lists/](https://www.random.org/lists/).

# Examples

## GodSpeed scale (semantic differntial scale)

The [GodSpeed scale](http://www.bartneck.de/2008/03/11/the-godspeed-questionnaire-series/) described by Bartneck et al. (2009) is a semantic differntial scale. The `GodSpeed-items.csv` contains the differential pairs.

## RoSA scale (Likert-type scale)
The [RoSAS](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3020208) designed by Carpinella et al. (2017) uses a Likert-scale (It is not defined whether it is a 5, 7 or 9-point Likert-scale). The template was designed according to suggestions by the authors.
